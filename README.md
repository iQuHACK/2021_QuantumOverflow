# Welcome to iQuHACK 2021!
Check out some info in the [event's repository](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021) to get started.

Having a README in your team's repository facilitates judging. A good README contains:
* a clear title for your project,
* a short abstract,
* the motivation/goals for your project,
* a description of the work you did, and
* proposals for future work.

You can find a potential README template in [one of last year's projects](https://github.com/iQuHACK/QuhacMan).

Feel free to contact the staff with questions over our [event's slack](https://iquhack.slack.com), or via iquhack@mit.edu.

Good luck!

# Quantum Colossal Cave Adventure: An educational quantum game

Miasya Bulger, Corbin McElhanney, Matthew Mikhailov, Alejandro Montanez, Ben Sachs.

## Introduction

In Quantum Colossal Cave Adventure you are going to find a fun way to learn concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and a set of quantum basic algorithms while you enjoy diving in the well-known Colossal cave adventure. ss

## Basic principles

## Elements and rules

## Demonstrations:

The GitHub repository link is [https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021_QuantumOverflow](https://github.com/iQuHACK/2021_QuantumOverflow).


## ToDo:
### Things we would wanna fix/implement but didn't have enough time to do


* Graphics
* Educational things 
* circuit and state visualization inside the game
* Option to pick between real and simulated quantum simulation 

## Highlights:



*   In our game, the result is quantum. No one knows the results until the measurement.
*    Player can increase their probability of winning, but nothing is guaranteed.
*   During the game, two players are building a quantum circuit together. They try interfering with the result of the entangled qubits to something they desire.
*   In the game, we applied Quantum Random Number Generator to find the type and place of gates. The speeds of Quhacmans change with entangled two qubits circuit.
*   The rule and strategy are quantum. We use Bloch sphere as a win indicator.
